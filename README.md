# sys-netcheat-gui
### A decent (but kinda buggy) interface for [sys-netcheat](https://github.com/jakibaki/sys-netcheat), built on Qt
## Usage
Read the readme for sys-netcheat and you'll get it
## Notes
 * Attempts to search for very common values (mainly 0x0-0x10) will usually crash this
 * Searching may take a while, especially with bigger games. Be patient and don't hit x as soon as it stops responding
 * Freezing many values at once can get a bit buggy, so watch out
 * Do not be deterred if the switch is not found when it just worked a second ago, as it is very inconsistent. Just keep trying
 * I don't know C++, so don't look at the code please
 * This is a one-and-done project, support will be minimal
